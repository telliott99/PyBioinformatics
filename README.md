I feel kind of silly to realize after several years that I did not explain how to generate the html pages from this repository.

I used [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/).

If you have Sphinx and you clone the repo, just cd into it and do `make html` and "Bob's your uncle", as my friend used to say.

If you don't have Sphinx, try first doing `easy_install -U sphinx`.
