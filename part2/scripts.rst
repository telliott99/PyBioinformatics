Scripts
#######

Starting with this chapter, I have included scripts that may run to more than 50 lines of code, although we'll still demo simple things with the interpreter.

I'm showing such 'long' programs even though I have to confess that I have not often done anything other than skim through an example of more than a dozen lines in any programming book.

So why are they here?  It's simply that many good examples require a significant amount of code (although I hope never more than 100 lines).  

And a huge advantage of an ebook is to enable simple copy and paste.  The hope is that you'll copy the text of a code segment into a file called ``script.py`` (perhaps occasionally a different title), and then run it from the command line by doing ``python script.py`` in Terminal as described in the early part of the first chapter.  

If I've tested carefully enough, you will get the output I've shown.

Of course, it would be even better if you decided to attack the problems yourself, and write your own programs.  In that case, use the code provided as a reference:  you might find a solution to some tricky issue in the code that I've provided.
