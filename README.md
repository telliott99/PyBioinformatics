I realized after a long time that I did not explain how to generate the html pages from this [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) repository, written in [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html).

Luckily, github does a pretty good job of rendering these `rst` files.

To generate html, if you have Sphinx and you clone the repo, just cd into it and do `make html` and "Bob's your uncle", as my friend used to say.

If you don't have Sphinx, try first doing `easy_install -U Sphinx`.
